# ECG Classification with Grad-CAM

This repository implements a comprehensive pipeline for classifying ECG signals and visualizing feature importance using Grad-CAM. It is based on the implementation of the paper **"ECG Heartbeat Classification: A Deep Transferable Representation"** ([arXiv:1805.00794](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00794)), with the added feature of 1D Grad-CAM for model interpretability. The dataset used in this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat).

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify ECG signals into different heart conditions and explain the modelâ€™s predictions using Grad-CAM. The workflow includes:

- Implementing the deep learning model from the referenced paper.
- Training the model on the MIT-BIH dataset.
- Fine-tuning the model on the PTB dataset using transfer learning.
- Adding 1D Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability.


## Model Architecture

The implemented 1D convolutional neural network (`ConvNet`) includes:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Fully connected layers for classification.
- A modifiable classifier for transfer learning on PTB data.

### Grad-CAM Integration

- Implements Grad-CAM for 1D CNNs, enabling visualization of the most influential regions in the ECG signal for predictions.



## Grad-CAM Visualization
Grad-CAM effectively highlights regions in the ECG signals that influence the model's decisions, providing better interpretability for predictions.

1. Generate Grad-CAM for an ECG signal:

   ```python
   from gradcam import GradCAM1D

   gradcam = GradCAM1D(model, target_layer=model.convnet[4].conv2)
   cam = gradcam.generate_cam(input_tensor, target_class=0)
   ```

2. Visualize the results:

   ```python
   from utils import plot_ecg_with_background_cam

   plot_ecg_with_background_cam(cam, ecg_signal)
   ```


## Results

### MIT-BIH Dataset

- **Accuracy**: Achieved **95.96%** on the test set.

### PTB Dataset (Transfer Learning)

- **Accuracy**: Achieved **91.28%** on the test set.
